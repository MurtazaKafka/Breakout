This README.md file provides a brief overview of the Breakout game project, including its features and dependencies. It also includes links to relevant resources, such as the license and acknowledgments, to help other developers understand the project and contribute to it if needed.

In this revised version of the README.md file, the setup instructions have been simplified because the project uses CDN instead of a modern toolchain.
